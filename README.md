# Tool Leveling

## About

Gain levels and enchantments through breaking blocks. All levels and experience are directly stored on the tools lore. Editing the lines where the levels / xp are may corrupt the plugin as there are no failsafes for this.

## Compiling

1. Clone the repository directly into your IDE.
2. Build Spigot with [Spigot's Build Tools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) then add the JAR to the projects build path.
3. Fix any outdated code in the project depending on what version of Spigot you installed.
4. Compile the plugin by exporting it to a JAR file.
